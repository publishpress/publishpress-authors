== Description ==

[PublishPress Authors](https://publishpress.com/authors/) allows you to create, manage and display authors for all your WordPress content. The plugin provides author boxes that can display one author, coauthors, multiple authors or even guest authors. The boxes have the author bio, name, avatar, description and more.

= How do I import WordPress users to PublishPress Authors? =

PublishPress Authors does use a different system than the WordPress core, so there may be some work involved with moving author data.

When you first install PublishPress Authors, our plugin will try to import all your authors. However, there may be some more work needed if you have a large site or have been using a different plugin. After installing PublishPress Authors, go to the “Posts” screen to see if your authors have imported correctly.

If you have a very large site with 1,000s or authors or posts, we recommend you use the WP CLI command line system.
